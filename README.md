# JARVIS-SYSTEM-AUTOMATION
Jarvis is a voice-enabled AI virtual assistant inspired by Iron Man’s J.A.R.V.I.S, built using Ollama (local LLM) for offline intelligence. It supports wake-word activation (“Hey Jarvis”), speech recognition, text-to-speech responses, short intelligent replies, and contextual memory. Jarvis can answer knowledgeable questions, understand English and Hindi, and is designed with a modular architecture for system control, skills, and future expansions — all running locally without paid APIs.
